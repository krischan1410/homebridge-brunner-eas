# Homebridge Brunner EAS Plugin

</span>

This is a simple Homebridge plugin providing access to the EAS device of Brunner (Elektrische Abbrand-Steuerung = Electric Burndown Control). It implements a single accessory, the temparature sensor located inside the oven.
### Watch For Changes and Build Automatically


### Customise Plugin

Currently there is not that much to configure. The next versions will introduce the name of the device and the port to listen as settings, currently they are fixed to "Brunner EAS" and 45454, which should fit the normal usage with just one device in the house.
