# Homebridge Brunner EAS Plugin

</span>

This is a simple Homebridge plugin providing access to the EAS device of Brunner (Elektrische Abbrand-Steuerung = Electric Burndown Control). It implements a single accessory, the temperature sensor located inside the oven.


### Customise Plugin

You can configure four properties of this is plugin.
+ The `name` of the platform as used in the logs of Homebridge. The default value most probably fits.
+ The `accessoryName` of the EAS device. You may accept the default value, but feel free to change it to something personal, because this name is visibly in Home app.
+ The `port` number that this plugin listens to. This should fit - you shou√∂d only change it if your EAS device broadcasts to a different port.
+ The `refillHint` string, which defines - if set - the name of an additional switch accessory which is turned on when EAS advises to refill.
